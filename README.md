## Introduction
Flashcards, the time-tested study companion, offer a simple yet powerful way to learn and retain information effectively. With their concise format and versatility, flashcards provide a structured approach to reviewing key concepts, vocabulary, and facts across various subjects. Whether used for exam preparation, language learning, or professional development, flashcards empower learners to engage actively with the material, reinforce knowledge through repetition, and achieve mastery efficiently. In an age of digital innovation, flashcard applications and generators bring this traditional study tool into the modern era, offering convenience, customization, and enhanced learning experiences for users of all ages and backgrounds.

## Features
The application offers several notable features:

- **Flashcard Creation:** Users can effortlessly craft new flashcards through a streamlined form interface. The primary form encompasses fields for flashcard titles and descriptions, while the term form enables users to add multiple terms to each flashcard, complete with titles and definitions. Additional terms can be dynamically added or removed as needed.

- **My Flashcards:** This section provides users with an organized overview of all their created flashcards. Each flashcard is presented alongside its corresponding title and description, facilitating swift navigation to the desired card.

- **Flashcard Details:** Users can delve into the specifics of individual flashcards on this dedicated page. The title and description of the flashcard are prominently displayed, while a comprehensive list of terms is showcased on the left side. Clicking on any term brings its details to the forefront, allowing seamless navigation between terms via an intuitive carousel equipped with directional arrows.

- **Share Flashcards:** Users have the convenience of sharing their meticulously crafted flashcards with others via the share button. This action triggers a modal window containing a unique link to the flashcard, accompanied by a copy button for effortless dissemination.

- **Download Functionality:** The application incorporates a feature enabling users to download their flashcards as PDF files. This downloadable PDF encapsulates all pertinent flashcard details, including titles, descriptions, and associated terms.

- **Offline Study with Physical Copies:** For those inclined towards tactile learning or seeking a reliable offline study aid, the application facilitates the printing of physical copies of flashcards. This feature ensures accessibility and convenience, allowing users to engage with their study materials even when disconnected from the digital realm.

## Happy Learning

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
